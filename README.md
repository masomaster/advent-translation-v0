# Advent Translation

## About

This is a project, modeled after [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), providing 25 days of translation practice from Hebrew and Greek verses in the Bible. It is currently in the planning and prototyping stages.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Technologies

The project itself is fairly simple, but I am using it as an opportunity to learn and practice some new technologies. The following is a list of technologies that will be used in this project:

New to me:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Jest/Mocha
- Redux
- Firebase
- Various smaller libraries for features and styling

Familiar to me includes:

- React
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express
